Python Challenge
# Python Challenge- Py Me Up, Charlie

## Background

Well... I've made it!

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this challenge, i'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the **two** Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

Both of these challenges encompass a real-world situation where my newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. These challenges are far from easy so expect some hard work ahead!

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

* In this challenge, I am  are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of my company. I will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. (Thankfully, my company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

* My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average Change: $-426534.66
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($302709)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2064109)


## PyPoll

![Vote Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

* In this challenge, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* I will be given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
