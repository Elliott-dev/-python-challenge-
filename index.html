<p>
  I am a Data Analyst who believes the strategic analysis and communication of data is a key factor in achieving an organization’s goals.
  I hold a Certificate in Data Analysis and Visualization and over 100 classroom hours of experience managing and visualizing big data sets using technologies such as Python, Pandas, and MySQL. I have written code for a variety of data sets and can effectively communicate insights from data. 
  My experience as a Manager at one of the top-performing Sam’s Clubs in the Midwest region has taught me the importance of data collection and using that data to inform decisions. 
  <br>
  <br>
  I bring the following to every project:
  Problem-solving skills and perseverance
  Experience in business metrics and statistics with a Bachelor’s in Biological Science
  Dedication to teamwork and flexible collaboration
  A foundational knowledge in machine learning
  <br>
  <br>
  Eager to connect with you to learn more about what I can do to provide data-centric solutions to your organization.
